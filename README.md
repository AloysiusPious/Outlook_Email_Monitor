This Python code addresses the following:

1. Outlook and Python code should be on same machine
2. The script reads emails and generates a Monitoring report, then sends it automatically to recipients defined in the config file.
2. If your organization lacks a monitoring dashboard but receives a lot of emails daily, you can create a folder named 'outlook' and redirect all emails from monitoring systems to it. Then, you can run this Python code on a daily or weekly basis to generate the .csv report and various charts.
3. Check out this Python function to capture the email content required to generate the report: `read_outlook_write_to_csv()`.
4. Slight modifications are required in this code to seamlessly capture and generate the report for your organization.
